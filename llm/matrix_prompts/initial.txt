I am using MFEA algorithm to optimize some different tasks. Help me generate 4 different guide lines to create a RMP (Random Mating Probability) matrix using the following information:
- 'task_count': Number of tasks
- 'diversity': List of genetic diversity values for each task
- 'convergence': List of convergence rates for each task
- 'fitness_variance': List of fitness variance values for each task
- 'offspring_success_rate': The overall success rate of crossover offsprings have better fitness than their parents
Each guide line can be based on some of the above information to optimize the RMP matrix, should not be too simple. Output must be a valid JSON object with the following format: {{ "strategy": [ "guide line 1", "guide line 2", "guide line 3", "guide line 4"] }}. Do not number the guide lines you create. Follow the format and do not give any further explain.
