I am using MFEA algorithm to optimize some different tasks. Help me generate {0} different strategies to create a RMP (Random Mating Probability) matrix with some information are task_count, task_performance, diversity, convergence and task_similarity where:
- 'task_count': Number of tasks
- 'task_performance': List of convergence percentages for each task (0 to 100)
- 'diversity': List of genetic diversity values for each task
- 'convergence': List of convergence rates for each task
- 'task_similarity': List of tuples (i, j, similarity) indicating similarity between tasks T_i and T_j (0 to 1)
Each strategy can be based on some of the above information to optimize the RMP matrix, should not be too simple. Output must be a valid JSON object with the following format: {{ "strategies": [ "strategy 1", "strategy 2", "strategy 3", ... ] }}. Do not number the strategies you create. Follow the format and do not give any further explain.
