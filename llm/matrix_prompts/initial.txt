I am using MFEA algorithm to optimize some different tasks. Please help me generate {0} ideas to create a function that generates a RMP(Random Mating Probability) array from a set of parents. This function takes six inputs: 'p1', 'p2', 'p1_skill_factor', 'p2_skill_factor','p1_fitness','p2_fitness' where 'p1','p2' are the parents; 'p1_fitness','p2_fitness' are the current parents' fitness score; 'p1_skill_factor','p2_skill_factor' are the skill factor of current parents. All are numpy arrays. The idea contains only text instructions, without any mathematical formulas. The idea should not be too simple.
Each idea consists of only 1 short sentence and be generated on a single row. The result is {0} ideas on {0} rows. No other information is given. The output should only contain the output ideas, without any symbols or numbering.
