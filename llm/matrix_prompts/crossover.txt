I am using MFEA algorithm to optimize some different tasks. Below is the two strategies to create a RMP (Random Mating Probability) matrix for crossover process and their performace.
Strategy 1: 
{0}
Strategy 1's performance: {1}
Strategy 2: 
{2}
Strategy 2's performance: {3}
The performance of a strategy is the percentage of offsprings that have better fitness than their parents.
Analyze these strategies and the differences between their performances and give me a new strategy that has 4 guide lines to create the mentioned matrix using the following information:
- 'task_count': Number of tasks
- 'diversity': List of genetic diversity values for each task
- 'convergence': List of convergence rates for each task
- 'fitness_variance': List of fitness variance values for each task
- 'offspring_success_rate': The overall success rate of crossover offsprings have better fitness than their parents
The strategy should not be too simple. Output must be a valid JSON object with the following format: {{ "strategy": [ "guide line 1", "guide line 2", "guide line 3", "guide line 4"] }}. Do not number the guide lines you create. Follow the format and do not give any further explain.
