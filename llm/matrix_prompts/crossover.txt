I am using MFEA algorithm to optimize some different tasks.Below is the two strategies to create a RMP (Random Mating Probability) matrix for crossover process and their performace.
Strategy 1: {0}
Strategy 1's performance: {1}
Strategy 2: {2}
Strategy 2's performance: {3}
The performance of a strategy is the percentage of offsprings that have better fitness than their parents.
Analyze these strategies and the differences between their performances and give me a new strategy to create the mentioned matrix with some information are task_count, task_performance, diversity, convergence and task_similarity where:
- 'task_count': Number of tasks
- 'task_performance': List of convergence percentages for each task (0 to 100)
- 'diversity': List of genetic diversity values for each task
- 'convergence': List of convergence rates for each task
- 'task_similarity': List of Wtuples (i, j, similarity) indicating similarity between tasks T_i and T_j (0 to 1)
The strategy should not be too simple. The output strategy must consist of only 1 sentence and no more than 50 words, without any symbols or numbering.
