I am using MFEA algorithm to optimize some different tasks. From the strategy below and its performance where performance is the percentage of offsprings that have better fitness than their parents, please help me generate an mutation strategy that has 4 guide lines to create a RMP (Random Mating Probability) matrix using the following information:
- 'task_count': Number of tasks
- 'diversity': List of genetic diversity values for each task
- 'convergence': List of convergence rates for each task
- 'fitness_variance': List of fitness variance values for each task
- 'offspring_success_rate': The overall success rate of crossover offsprings have better fitness than their parents
Strategy: 
{0}
Strategy's performance: {1}
The new mutation strategy must:
- Be based on the original strategy but introduce meaningful variations
- Modify or extend one or more guide lines to encourage better exploration or adaptation
- Preserve part of the original logic or assumptions, but shift focus, thresholds, or priority if needed
- Avoid simple rewording or cosmetic changes; ensure the result is a true variation with practical impact
Output must be a valid JSON object with the following format: {{ "strategy": [ "guide line 1", "guide line 2", "guide line 3", "guide line 4"] }}. Do not number the guide lines you create. Follow the format and do not give any further explain.
