I am using MFEA algorithm to optimize some different tasks. From the strategy below, help me generate an reversed strategy that has 4 guide lines to create a RMP (Random Mating Probability) matrix using the following information:
- 'task_count': Number of tasks
- 'diversity': List of genetic diversity values for each task
- 'convergence': List of convergence rates for each task
- 'fitness_variance': List of fitness variance values for each task
- 'offspring_success_rate': The overall success rate of crossover offsprings have better fitness than their parents
Strategy: {0}
The reversed strategy must:
- Oppose the reasoning or behavior in the original strategy
- Shift priorities or thresholds in the opposite direction
- Not be trivially reworded; the logic must be meaningfully reversed
- Still be coherent and potentially useful under different population states
Output must be a valid JSON object with the following format: {{ "strategy": [ "guide line 1", "guide line 2", "guide line 3", "guide line 4"] }}. Do not number the guide lines you create. Follow the format and do not give any further explain.
