I am using MFEA algorithm to optimize some different tasks. From the strategy below, help me generate an reversed strategy to create a RMP (Random Mating Probability) matrix with some information are task_count, diversity, convergence and task_similarity where:
- 'task_count': Number of tasks
- 'diversity': List of genetic diversity values for each task
- 'convergence': List of convergence rates for each task
- 'task_similarity': List of Wtuples (i, j, similarity) indicating similarity between tasks T_i and T_j (0 to 1)
Strategy: {0}
The strategy should not be too simple. The output strategy must consist of only 1 sentence and no more than 50 words, without any symbols or numbering.
