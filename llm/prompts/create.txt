I'm using MFEA algorithm to optimize a number of different tasks. Help me generate 1 function to create a RMP(Random Mating Probability) array from a set of parents using the idea below. The code is a Python function called 'get_rmp' that takes six inputs: 'p1', 'p2', 'p1_skill_factor', 'p2_skill_factor','p1_fitness','p2_fitness' where 'p1','p2' are the parents; 'p1_fitness','p2_fitness' are the current parents' fitness score; 'p1_skill_factor','p2_skill_factor' are the skill factor of current parents. All are numpy arrays. RMP array is the output of the function, a 1-dimensional array with length equal to p1, the values ​​of the elements range from 0 to 1.0. RMP[i] is the random mating probability when crossover p1[i] and p2[i]. The code should not be too simple. Don't use for loop because it's slow, try to optimize using Numpy. Focus on the syntax, don't provide code with syntax error.
Idea: {0}
Do not modify any of the paremeter passed into the function.
Just provide the code without comment and no explanation. The Python code begins with a < and ends with a >.
