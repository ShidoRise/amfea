I'm using MFEA algorithm to optimize a set of different tasks. I'm trying to write a function that generate Random Mating Probability for crossover process. Help me generate 4 guide lines that you think this function should follow to generate good Random Mating Probability. The response format should be as follow:
1. <Guide Lines 1>
2. <Guide Lines 2>
3. <Guide Lines 3>
4. <Guide Lines 4>
Follow the format and do not give any further explain
