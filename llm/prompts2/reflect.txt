I using MFEA algorithm to optimize a set of different tasks. These are the two strategies i used to create a function that generates Random Mating Probability for crossover process and their performace.
Strategy 1:
{0}
Strategy 1 performance: {1}
Strategy 2:
{2}
Strategy 2 performance: {3}
The performance of a strategy is the percentage of offsprings that have better fitness than their parents.
Analyze these strategies and the differences between their performances and give me a new strategy to create the mentioned function. A strategy should be in the form of 4 guide lines for the function. 
The response format should be as follow:
1. <Guide Lines 1>
2. <Guide Lines 2>
3. <Guide Lines 3>
4. <Guide Lines 4>
Follow the format and do not give any further explain
