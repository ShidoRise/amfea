I using MFEA algorithm to optimize a set of different tasks. This is the strategy i used to create a function that generates Random Mating Probability for crossover process and its performace.
The performance of a strategy is the percentage of offsprings that have better fitness than their parents range from 0 to 1.
Strategy:
{0}
Performance: {1}
Analyze the strategy and its performance and give me a new strategy to create the mentioned function. A strategy should be in the form of 4 guide lines for the function. 
The response format should be as follow:
1. <Guide Lines 1>
2. <Guide Lines 2>
3. <Guide Lines 3>
4. <Guide Lines 4>
Follow the format and do not give any further explain
